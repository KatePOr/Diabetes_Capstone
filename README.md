# Assessing the Influence of Social, Demographic, and Health Factors on Diabetes Risk
## Background & Question
### Research Question:
"How do social factors, demographic characteristics, and health conditions influence the likelihood of developing diabetes?"
### What Need or Niche Does It Fill?
This question addresses the need to understand how social factors, demographic characteristics and health conditions shape the risk of diabetes. Often, the focus is on clinical data, while social and lifestyle factors are underexplored. This study aims to bridge that gap by examining the combined impact of these variables, offering a more holistic view of diabetes risk. Rajendra et. al. is a study in 2021 that looked at the incidence of diabetes in women over 21 years of age. This study, among many others, focused on general variables that could be indicators of diabetes and trained the model. This project aims to compare social factors, demographic characteristics, and health conditions. The World Health Organization reports that the number of individuals with diabetes increased from “108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014”. “In 2019, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and 48% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years” (World Health Organization, 2023).Diabetes is a disease that has a large impact worldwide and also comes with significant stigma attached to a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. This project aims to determine that lifestyle choices are not the only or, necessarily, the most important indicator of diabetes. 
### Why Is It Worth Exploring?
The increasing prevalence of diabetes, especially in vulnerable populations, would benefit from a deeper understanding of the social and demographic factors influencing it. By exploring these aspects in combination with health conditions, we can offer more tailored prevention strategies for at-risk groups. This research is valuable in helping public health initiatives address not just medical but also socio-environmental contributors to diabetes.
### Is the Question Novel or Original?
This question is not entirely new but offers a fresh perspective by integrating social and demographic factors with health conditions to predict diabetes risk. While research exists on individual factors, this study takes a more comprehensive approach by looking at how these elements interact. The use of multiple data sources and combining social factors with health conditions provides new opportunities for insights and interventions.
### Hypothesis:
Social factors (e.g., income, education), demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender), and health conditions (e.g., hypertension, BMI) together influence the likelihood of developing diabetes.
### Prediction:
The data will show that certain demographic groups (e.g., older individuals or those from lower-income backgrounds) who also have specific health conditions (e.g., higher BMI, hypertension) are more likely to develop diabetes. Additionally, social factors such as limited access to healthcare and education will likely increase the risk of developing diabetes.
